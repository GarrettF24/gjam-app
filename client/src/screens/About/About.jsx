                We are a small grassroots company brought together by our passion
                of jam. g'JAM is proud to say that all of our ingredients come
                directly from us or local farms and fruit curators. Due to this, we can always
                guarantee the freshest of fruits and spices. We are commited to this promise.
              </p> 
              <p className="info-paragraph">
                We believe that everyone is
                unique, so why shouldnâ€™t your jam be unique too? g'JAM began one
                day right in our backyards when we were pushed to action by the
                over-sugared, super over-preserved jams that saturate the market
                today. Grab any store brand and dip a spoon in and you'll have a
                sugar overdose in a single scoop. Then taste ours (once you have
                recovered), and the decision will be made for you, you will never go
                back! 
              </p>
              <p className="info-paragraph">
                The one thing we hear most from our satisified customers is
                that they do not experience the cloying taste that is so often
                assosicated with store brand. Basically ours is better in
                everyway. Our jam is a must for any health food snob that can't go
                a day without telling someone how they should switch over to
                organic and locally sourced so they can get that brief sense of
                superiority that brightens an otherwise dull life for a just a
                moment.

              <p className="info-paragraph">
                Our superb chef Josh curates all of our jam flavors by combining
                his knowledge of great flavor combinations with his obsession for
                taking risks. We begin in our home kitchen. Then the products, if not taken from our own
                garden, are procured through local farmers, supporting our region
                and sticking it to the corporations. 
              </p>

              <p className="info-paragraph">
                Believe it or not, canning
                our jams is the most important step in our process. Every single
                jam is jarred by our jam-jarring expert Jexica. The jars are
                sanitized and filled while hot, and then we stick them upside down for
                awhile. Why do we do this? It helps to sanitize the lids and prevents
                oxygen from getting into our stellar jam. This makes it possible
                for the jars to sit on a shelf for up to a year without spoiling.
                But honestly, if our jam sits on your shelf for up to a year just
                lose our number, we don't want your business.  
              </p>

              <p className="info-paragraph">
                All of our jams are
                made by hand by Casey in very small batches. We cook our jams in
                one of two ways: slow cooking, to produce a thick, savory and sweet,
                buttery spread, or quick cooking, to retain as much color and
                flavor in the fruit as possible. We add no sugar, gone with the
                pectin, and we will literally die before putting preservatives in
                our jam. Enjoy with a spoon, spread on toast or bread. Or
                Garrett's personal favorite, just open it and use your hand as a
                scoop.
